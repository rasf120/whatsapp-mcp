# WhatsApp MCP Server

**Your WhatsApp groups are a live intelligence network. This server lets Claude read them.**

An open-source [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that connects WhatsApp group chats to Claude (and any MCP-compatible AI client). It exposes seven tools for reading, searching, exporting, and replying to group conversations — plus a chat intelligence processor that extracts themes, opportunities, and actionable briefings from hundreds of messages.

I built this because I'm in a dozen professional WhatsApp groups — practitioners, investors, founders — where the information density is remarkable and the retrieval rate is abysmal. WhatsApp is optimized for *conversation*, not *comprehension*. This server fixes that.

## What It Does

**Seven MCP tools** give Claude (or any MCP client) structured access to your WhatsApp groups:

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| `whatsapp_list_groups` | Every group you belong to, sorted by recent activity |
| `whatsapp_get_messages` | Pull messages from any group with date range filtering |
| `whatsapp_group_info` | Metadata, participants, descriptions |
| `whatsapp_search_messages` | Keyword search across all groups or scoped to one |
| `whatsapp_export_chat` | Full export in WhatsApp's native `.txt` format |
| `whatsapp_send_message` | Send a message to any group (fuzzy name matching) |
| `whatsapp_reply_to_message` | Reply to a specific message as a quoted reply |

All tools support **fuzzy group name matching** — say "Book Club" and it finds "Book Club — Monthly Reads" using Levenshtein distance + substring matching. Nobody remembers exact group names. The system shouldn't require you to.

**A chat intelligence processor** turns raw messages into structured briefings:

- **Themes** — recurring topics tagged as hot, important, or emerging
- **Big ideas** — intellectually interesting or actionable, flagged by relevance to your work
- **Opportunities** — collaboration, speaking, partnerships, content ideas, business leads
- **Participation analysis** — what you engage with vs. skip, where you're visible vs. silent
- **Live threads** — active conversations worth jumping into, with suggested messages
- **Notable quotes** — standout lines worth saving or citing
- **Cross-group synthesis** — amplified signals, network nodes, compounding opportunities that only appear when you look across groups

The intelligence processor was inspired by [Scott Walker](https://github.com/Scottywalks22) (Founder & CEO, [UpShift Collective](https://www.upshiftcollective.com/)), who built the [Junto Group Analyzer](https://juntogroupanalyzer.lovable.app/) — a Claude skill he shared with our professional group that demonstrated the value of structured analysis over raw message consumption. His six-output framework (themes, big ideas, opportunities, participation analysis, live threads, notable quotes) proved the concept. This implementation extends it into a real-time MCP server with multi-group synthesis and configurable professional context.

└─────────────┘                └───────────────┘
```

Two transport modes, one WhatsApp client:

- **Claude Code** → stdio transport (`index.ts`) — direct pipe, single session
- **Cowork / Desktop** → StreamableHTTP transport (`http-server.ts`) — multi-session over HTTPS via Cloudflare tunnel

WhatsApp has no open API for group chats. The Business API is for customer messaging only. So this server uses [Baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys) — a direct WebSocket implementation of the WhatsApp Multi-Device protocol. No headless browser, no DOM scraping. Credentials and Signal Protocol keys persist to `.baileys_auth-<session>/` via `useMultiFileAuthState`, and the client reconnects in roughly two seconds after restarts.

Every read and write flows through an **AsyncMutex** that serializes WhatsApp operations behind a FIFO queue with a 100ms minimum interval. Baileys is reentrant-safe, but Signal Protocol session setup on unfamiliar recipients benefits from serialization, and the mutex keeps us well under WhatsApp's rate-limit thresholds without having to reason about them explicitly.

Messages stream in over the WebSocket and land in an **in-memory ring buffer** — 500 messages per group, JID-keyed — that the tool layer reads from. The buffer snapshots to `.baileys_auth-<session>/buffer.json` every 60 seconds and rehydrates on boot. This is load-bearing, not optional: the `messages.history-set` event that Baileys emits on first pairing is a one-shot, so on any reconnect the snapshot is the only thing standing between you and a cold buffer.

A **readiness gate** keeps this honest. Tool calls return `503 Service Unavailable` until the WebSocket has reached `connection.update → open` AND the buffer is warm (either `messages.history-set` has drained or 30 seconds have elapsed). The server never crashes into half-initialized state, and clients get a clean retryable error instead.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- A WhatsApp account (pairs via QR code on first run)

### Install and Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ericporres/whatsapp-mcp-server.git
cd whatsapp-mcp-server
npm install
npm run build
```

### Access policy (this fork)

This fork is fail-closed. Two environment variables control what the server exposes:

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `WHATSAPP_GROUP_ALLOWLIST` | empty | Pipe-separated group names or JIDs. Only these groups are listed, readable, searchable, or buffered to disk. Empty means no groups at all. Names match case- and punctuation-insensitively; JIDs match exactly; there is no substring matching. |
| `WHATSAPP_READ_ONLY` | `true` | When true the `whatsapp_send_message` and `whatsapp_reply_to_message` tools are not registered and are refused if called anyway. Only the literal string `false` enables sending. |

Personal (non-group) chats are never written to the message buffer regardless of settings. Groups outside the allowlist are purged from the buffer as soon as the allowlist is resolved against the live group list, and again on every reconnect.

Auth state and the buffer live in `.baileys_auth-<session>/` next to this repo (override with `WHATSAPP_AUTH_DIR`), so the server works no matter which directory the MCP host starts it from.

### First Run — QR Pairing

```bash
npm run pair
```

`pair` links the device (QR on first run), prints every group on the account with its JID, marks the ones the current allowlist matches, and exits. Use it to pick the names for `WHATSAPP_GROUP_ALLOWLIST`. It is the only code path that lists groups outside the allowlist, and it is not reachable through MCP.

Or, without the group listing:

```bash
WHATSAPP_SESSION_NAME=my-session node dist/mcp-server/index.js
```

Scan the QR code with WhatsApp on your phone. Credentials and Signal keys cache in `.baileys_auth-my-session/` — you won't need to scan again unless you remove that directory or revoke the linked device from your phone.

### Register with Claude Code

Add to `~/.claude.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "whatsapp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/whatsapp-mcp-server/dist/mcp-server/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "WHATSAPP_SESSION_NAME": "my-session",
        "WHATSAPP_GROUP_ALLOWLIST": "Group One|Group Two",
        "WHATSAPP_READ_ONLY": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then ask Claude: *"What WhatsApp groups am I in?"*

### HTTP Server (Cowork / Remote Access)

The HTTP server supports multiple concurrent MCP sessions. Each `initialize` handshake spawns a fresh Server + Transport pair. All sessions share the single WhatsApp client (protected by the mutex). Sessions are tracked in a `Map<string, McpSession>` with 30-minute TTL and automatic cleanup.

Pick any free high port on your machine and set it as `MCP_HTTP_PORT`. The server binds to `127.0.0.1` only — a tunnel or reverse proxy is responsible for exposing it.

```bash
# pick any free high port on your machine
MCP_HTTP_PORT=<your-port> node dist/mcp-server/http-server.js
```

Expose over HTTPS with a Cloudflare tunnel:

```bash
# Quick tunnel (temporary URL)
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:$MCP_HTTP_PORT

# Named tunnel (stable URL — recommended for persistent setups)
cloudflared tunnel run your-tunnel-name
```

### Securing the Tunnel

The server runs locally — your machine, your data, your paired WhatsApp session. But exposing it via a Cloudflare tunnel creates a public HTTPS endpoint. You should lock it down.

**Security tiers** (pick your comfort level):

| Tier | What It Does | Effort | Notes |
|------|-------------|--------|-------|
| **Obscurity** (default) | Long random subdomain — `mcp-random-words-123.yourdomain.com` | Zero — automatic | Treat the URL like a password |
| **IP Restriction** | Cloudflare Access policy allows only your IP | 5 min in [Zero Trust dashboard](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/) | **See caveat below** |
| **Bearer Token** | Server validates `Authorization` header on every request | ~20 lines in `http-server.ts` | Requires client support for custom headers |
| **Email OTP** | Cloudflare Access sends a one-time code to your email | 10 min in Zero Trust dashboard | Works if your client handles browser auth flows |
| **OAuth/OIDC** (recommended for remote) | Full identity provider integration (Google, Okta, etc.) | 30 min — identity provider config | Best option for cloud-hosted MCP clients |

> **Important caveat about IP restriction:** Cloudflare Access IP whitelisting works well for clients that connect from your local machine (like Claude Code via stdio). However, cloud-hosted MCP clients — including Claude Cowork, and potentially other platforms that proxy MCP connections through their own infrastructure — connect from the *platform's* IP addresses, not yours. An IP whitelist locked to your home network will block these clients. I learned this the hard way: the tunnel was healthy, the server was running, and Cloudflare was dutifully rejecting every legitimate request from the desktop app I built this for.

**For local-only access (Claude Code, stdio):** Obscurity alone is sufficient — the tunnel isn't even needed since stdio is a direct pipe.

**For remote access (Cowork, Cursor, HTTP clients):** Obscurity is the practical baseline today. The random subdomain is effectively unguessable, and your tunnel URL should never appear in public repos, articles, or documentation. For stronger security, **OAuth/OIDC is the recommended path** — it's the only auth mechanism that both Cloudflare Access and cloud-hosted MCP clients (like Cowork's custom connector) natively support. Bearer tokens require custom HTTP headers, which not all MCP client UIs expose.

For bearer token authentication, set `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` in your environment and the HTTP server will validate the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header on every request. See `http-server.ts` for implementation. Note: this requires your MCP client to support custom request headers.

### macOS Persistence (LaunchAgents)

For always-on operation — server starts at login, tunnel reconnects automatically, logs to `~/Library/Logs/`:

```bash
# Edit the variables at the top of the script first (SESSION_NAME, MCP_PORT, TUNNEL_TOKEN)
chmod +x scripts/setup-persistence.sh
./scripts/setup-persistence.sh
```

Templates for the LaunchAgent plists are in `config/`. The script substitutes your paths, your chosen port, and your tunnel token, then loads them.

## Configuring the Intelligence Processor

The processor ships with a generic `EXAMPLE_CONTEXT` in `src/processor/analyzer.ts`. Replace it with your own professional context:

```typescript
export const EXAMPLE_CONTEXT: UserContext = {
  name: 'Your Name',
  aliases: ['YourName', 'yourname'],
  role: 'Your role and company',
  focusAreas: [
    'your focus area 1',
    'your focus area 2',
    'your product or platform',
  ],
  opportunityTypes: [
    'partnerships',
    'speaking',
    'pain points your product solves',
    'content ideas',
  ],
  contentOutlets: ['Your Newsletter', 'LinkedIn'],
};
```

This context is the difference between generic summaries and personalized intelligence. The analyzer uses it to flag opportunities that map to your work, assess your participation patterns, and surface cross-group signals that matter to *you specifically*.

Rebuild after editing: `npm run build`

## Cowork Plugin

The `plugin/` directory contains a Claude Desktop (Cowork) plugin with a `/whatsapp` slash command. It triggers the full intelligence pipeline: pull messages from your configured groups, run the analyzer, generate a structured briefing. Say "check my WhatsApp" and get the five things that actually matter.

## Design Decisions

**Baileys over a headless browser.** An earlier cut of this server drove WhatsApp Web through Puppeteer. It worked, but every failure mode was a browser failure — page-context crashes on large fetches, stale DOM references after reconnects, memory leaks from orphaned Chromium processes. Baileys speaks the WhatsApp Multi-Device protocol directly over a WebSocket. No browser, no DOM, no Chromium. Reconnects take two seconds instead of fifteen, and the whole surface area collapses to "is the socket open and is the buffer warm."

**In-memory ring buffer + disk snapshot.** Baileys streams messages in real time via `messages.upsert`, but its historical sync (`messages.history-set`) fires **once**, on the initial pairing. Every subsequent reconnect delivers only live traffic. That's a trap: a restart would otherwise start from an empty buffer and tools would return stale or partial results. The server keeps a 500-message-per-group ring buffer in memory, snapshots it to `.baileys_auth-<session>/buffer.json` every 60 seconds, and rehydrates on boot. The snapshot is load-bearing — do not treat it as a cache.

**Readiness gate, not a spinlock.** On cold start there's a window between "process alive" and "ready to serve." The server doesn't answer tool calls during that window; it returns `503 Service Unavailable` with a retry hint until `connection.update → open` fires AND the buffer is either drained from `history-set` or 30 seconds have elapsed. Clients that retry sensibly get clean results. Clients that don't fail fast instead of getting silently wrong data.

**AsyncMutex over rate limiting.** Every WhatsApp operation — reads, writes, metadata lookups — flows through a FIFO queue with a 100ms minimum interval between operations. Baileys itself is reentrant-safe, but Signal Protocol session setup on unfamiliar recipients benefits from serialization, and the mutex keeps us comfortably under WhatsApp's rate-limit thresholds without having to model them.

**Multi-session HTTP server.** The StreamableHTTP transport generates unique session IDs. Each Cowork `initialize` creates a fresh MCP Server + Transport pair. All sessions share the single WhatsApp client (already protected by the mutex). The `Map<string, McpSession>` tracks active sessions with 30-minute TTL — stale sessions are cleaned up automatically.

**Fuzzy group name matching.** Levenshtein distance + substring matching, case-insensitive. "book club" finds "Book Club — Monthly Reads." This is a small detail that makes the difference between a system you use daily and one you abandon after a week.

**Write tools require the same mutex.** `whatsapp_send_message` and `whatsapp_reply_to_message` go through the same AsyncMutex as every read. Quoted replies use Baileys' `quoted` field on `sendMessage`, so they render as native quoted messages on all clients — phones, desktop, web.

**Context > Intelligence.** The gap between a chatbot and a useful assistant is almost never a smarter model — it's better context. The `EXAMPLE_CONTEXT` object is a few lines of configuration that transforms the analyzer from generic summarization to personalized intelligence. A well-informed current model beats a brilliant amnesiac every time.
